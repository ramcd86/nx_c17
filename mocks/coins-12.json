{"base":{"symbol":"USD","sign":"$"},"coin":{"id":12,"uuid":"LtWwuVANwRzV_","slug":"iota-miota","symbol":"MIOTA","name":"IOTA","description":"<p>IOTA (MIOTA) is a cryptocurrency focussing on the internet of things. By using a tangle instead of a blockchain, it achieves a high level of transaction throughput. Besides, the network doesn't charge transaction fees, which makes microtransactions a reality.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Iota</h3>\n<p>IOTAâ€™s goal is to establish a digital ledger technology (DLT) for the Internet of Things (IoT). Their vision contains three fundamental parts. The first is scalability: process a substantial number of transactions per second across a large network of nodes, with fast confirmation times. The second is lightweight: low-power devices should be able to directly participate in the network. And the third is feeless: sending transactions should not require payment of network fees.</p>\n<h3>Who started Iota</h3>\n<p>In 2015, IOTA was founded by David Sonstebo, Sergey Ivancheglo, Dominik Schiener, and Dr. Serguei Popov. IOTA is controlled by the IOTA Foundation, which is a non-profit dedicated to developing the technology and maintaining it license-free for all developers to work with.</p>","color":"#000","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/H1IQ9Bdd-/miota.svg","websiteUrl":"http://iota.org/","socials":[{"name":"iotatoken","url":"https://twitter.com/iotatoken","type":"twitter"},{"name":"iotatangle","url":"https://t.me/iotatangle","type":"telegram"},{"name":"r/iota","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/iota/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Medium","url":"https://blog.iota.org/","type":"medium"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1216479.0","type":"bitcointalk"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/iotatoken/","type":"facebook"},{"name":"iotaledger","url":"https://github.com/iotaledger","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"iota.org","type":"website","url":"http://iota.org/"},{"name":"iotatoken","url":"https://twitter.com/iotatoken","type":"twitter"},{"name":"iotatangle","url":"https://t.me/iotatangle","type":"telegram"},{"name":"r/iota","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/iota/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Medium","url":"https://blog.iota.org/","type":"medium"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1216479.0","type":"bitcointalk"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/iotatoken/","type":"facebook"},{"name":"iotaledger","url":"https://github.com/iotaledger","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":65,"numberOfExchanges":21,"type":"coin","volume":257384062,"marketCap":4995468317,"price":"4.585777430071281","circulatingSupply":2779530283,"totalSupply":2779530283,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1497364209000,"listedAt":1497364209,"change":7.07,"rank":29,"history":["4.139712178228837","4.097983879472291","4.182156468356651","4.112690849417247","4.017317548619261","4.243090794851664","4.287218939118121","4.159717047868749","4.079101731481052","4.184505720222523","4.51466322154808","4.440171278392537","4.822914042589973","4.8844061966329955","4.774800121580551","4.654475158516721","4.554171218850686","4.6297704610836075","4.170034254298005","4.294843379529144","4.421498310791459","4.538579586061217","4.649048613185947","4.7853122280384275","4.700612201602147","4.647025222503882","4.585777430071281"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"5.773849630683582","timestamp":1513641600000},"penalty":false}}
