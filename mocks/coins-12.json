{"base":{"symbol":"USD","sign":"$"},"coin":{"id":12,"uuid":"LtWwuVANwRzV_","slug":"iota-miota","symbol":"MIOTA","name":"IOTA","description":"<p>IOTA (MIOTA) is a cryptocurrency focussing on the internet of things. By using a tangle instead of a blockchain, it achieves a high level of transaction throughput. Besides, the network doesn't charge transaction fees, which makes microtransactions a reality.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Iota</h3>\n<p>IOTAâ€™s goal is to establish a digital ledger technology (DLT) for the Internet of Things (IoT). Their vision contains three fundamental parts. The first is scalability: process a substantial number of transactions per second across a large network of nodes, with fast confirmation times. The second is lightweight: low-power devices should be able to directly participate in the network. And the third is feeless: sending transactions should not require payment of network fees.</p>\n<h3>Who started Iota</h3>\n<p>In 2015, IOTA was founded by David Sonstebo, Sergey Ivancheglo, Dominik Schiener, and Dr. Serguei Popov. IOTA is controlled by the IOTA Foundation, which is a non-profit dedicated to developing the technology and maintaining it license-free for all developers to work with.</p>","color":"#000","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/H1IQ9Bdd-/miota.svg","websiteUrl":"http://iota.org/","socials":[{"name":"iotatoken","url":"https://twitter.com/iotatoken","type":"twitter"},{"name":"iotatangle","url":"https://t.me/iotatangle","type":"telegram"},{"name":"r/iota","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/iota/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Medium","url":"https://blog.iota.org/","type":"medium"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1216479.0","type":"bitcointalk"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/iotatoken/","type":"facebook"},{"name":"iotaledger","url":"https://github.com/iotaledger","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"iota.org","type":"website","url":"http://iota.org/"},{"name":"iotatoken","url":"https://twitter.com/iotatoken","type":"twitter"},{"name":"iotatangle","url":"https://t.me/iotatangle","type":"telegram"},{"name":"r/iota","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/iota/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Medium","url":"https://blog.iota.org/","type":"medium"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1216479.0","type":"bitcointalk"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/iotatoken/","type":"facebook"},{"name":"iotaledger","url":"https://github.com/iotaledger","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":65,"numberOfExchanges":21,"type":"coin","volume":257384062,"marketCap":4995468317,"price":"3.6799929950227313","circulatingSupply":2779530283,"totalSupply":2779530283,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1497364209000,"listedAt":1497364209,"change":7.07,"rank":29,"history":["2.5893676838844812","2.645272132179547","2.4283598173408243","2.3863006253044814","2.3335633814852526","2.310064398233696","2.258018647341491","2.206377760876791","2.238612939963201","2.440311965853885","2.6472504205582945","2.6066680716111357","2.556593977955486","2.6202531680065775","2.822536712576685","2.8984064994107466","2.8387862777178676","2.9170516153945494","2.9765886388647522","3.1108327864775527","3.188541389483762","3.376665331463304","3.330843982915347","3.2968693742896105","3.5820485751656617","3.87326912432663","3.6799929950227313"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"5.773849630683582","timestamp":1513641600000},"penalty":false}}
