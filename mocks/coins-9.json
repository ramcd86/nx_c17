Cardano is built in the secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver lots of advanced features. It claims to be the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Cardano</h3>\n<p>In 2015, the Cardano project began as an effort to change the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed. The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration. Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. It started with a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. The Cardano platform now features decentralized applications and contracts that operate at low cost in a secure and scalable way.</p>\n<h3>Who started Cardano</h3>\n<p>Cardano was launched in 2017, and founded by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum. Charles said he wanted to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem for cryptocurrencies. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.</p>","color":"#3cc8c8","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/ryY28nXhW/ada.svg","websiteUrl":"https://www.cardano.org/en/home/","socials":[{"name":"cardano","url":"https://twitter.com/cardano","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/cardano","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Youtube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucbq9vgfezru1yri1zdcttgg","type":"youtube"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/cardanocommunity","type":"facebook"},{"name":"input-output-hk/cardano-sl","url":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"www.cardano.org","type":"website","url":"https://www.cardano.org/en/home/"},{"name":"cardano","url":"https://twitter.com/cardano","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/cardano","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Youtube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQ9vGfezru1YRI1zDCtTGg","type":"youtube"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/cardanocommunity","type":"facebook"},{"name":"input-output-hk/cardano-sl","url":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":240,"numberOfExchanges":94,"type":"coin","volume":2938938247,"marketCap":36981058071,"price":"0.09978570600028443","circulatingSupply":31112484745,"totalSupply":31112484745,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1506902400000,"listedAt":1506902400,"change":13.5,"rank":7,"history":["0.08510022963635405","0.08700732578250475","0.08464072652122062","0.0832517721990074","0.08526729760394536","0.08400789961833509","0.09056051578856522","0.09221958443781174","0.09454444016148897","0.10305343977602298","0.10439622609630456","0.10608326911002083","0.10416846610258496","0.10123716546645821","0.10004965351553666","0.0912953088329272","0.09350465530668405","0.09192442663200108","0.09393757157524191","0.09264405121465083","0.09033536145838172","0.08823687101170352","0.09012337531393375","0.08892022825349273","0.09322396730096177","0.09533362568098254","0.09978570600028443"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"1.4792150048125265","timestamp":1618358400000},"penalty":false}}
