    "description": "<p>Cardano (ADA) is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source. Cardano is built in the secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver lots of advanced features. It claims to be the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Cardano</h3>\n<p>In 2015, the Cardano project began as an effort to change the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed. The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration. Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. It started with a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. The Cardano platform now features decentralized applications and contracts that operate at low cost in a secure and scalable way.</p>\n<h3>Who started Cardano</h3>\n<p>Cardano was launched in 2017, and founded by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum. Charles said he wanted to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem for cryptocurrencies. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.</p>",
