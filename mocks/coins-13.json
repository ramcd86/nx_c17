    "description": "<p>Dash (DASH) is ‘digital cash’ that works like regular cash, allowing you to exchange your money at a highly secured open-source peer-to-peer network. It wants to enable the user to purchase items online or in-stores, without going through a central authority. Dash is based on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, and secured by strong cryptography. Dash describes itself as portable, inexpensive, divisible, and fast digital cash for both the internet and everyday life. Dash is an open protocol not under the control of any single entity. Anyone can write software to transact on the Dash network without requiring the permission of a central authority. Dash only asks a small fee to prevent spam attacks.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Dash</h3>\n<p>Dash is used around the world as a practical alternative to cash and credit cards, low fees and fast transactions. It is also meant as s solution in the international remittances market. It is particularly popular in regions where technical access barriers exist to traditional payment systems, or where hyperinflation has made existing currency impractical to use.</p>\n<h3>Who started Dash</h3>\n<p>Dash was launched in 2014 by founder Evan Duffield. The project is based on the Bitcoin project, mainly focussing on speed and fungibility. It aims to be a practical alternative to cash, both online and at the point of sale in shops and restaurants.</p>",
