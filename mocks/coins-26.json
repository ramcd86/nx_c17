    "description": "<p>Ontology aims to be a peer to peer trust network with a cross-chain, cross-app, cross-industry and cross-device distributed trust system, that has incorporated various trust types in an integrated multi-source protocol system. Ontology is designed to allow companies with no or little knowledge on cryptocurrency to integrate blockchain technology in their business. The Ontology network enables users to adapt public blockchains for different types of apps and get the most out of blockchain technology. The Ontology platform features two coins; the Ontology coin (ONT) and the Ontology Gas token (ONG).The ONT tokens are utility tokens giving access to Ontology's distributed services.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Ontology</h3>\n<p>Ontology was built with the intention to help companies to install their blockchain technology without making big changes to their existing internal systems. The creators wanted to make the process of integrating blockchain technologies easier and make the use of blockchain available and attainable for everyone.</p>\n<h3>Who started Ontology</h3>\n<p>In 2017 Ontology was founded by a Chinese company called OnChain. The founding team includes experts like Erik Zhang, Jun Li and Da HongFei. The company OnChain is also known as the founder of the NEO blockchain.</p>",
