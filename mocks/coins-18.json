{"base":{"symbol":"USD","sign":"$"},"coin":{"id":18,"uuid":"fsIbGOEJWbzxG","slug":"tezos-xtz","symbol":"XTZ","name":"Tezos","description":"<p>Tezos (XTZ) is a smart contract platform that uses blockchain voting to be self-governing by its token holders. Also, the platform aims to boost the security of smart contracts through formal verification of code. The creators of Tezos believe that a decentralized system must be decentralized at all levels; all the decisions must be taken decentralized, especially the proposals to improve or change the project.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Tezos</h3>\n<p>Tezos focusses on three main issues; smart contract safety, long-term upgradability, and open participation. Tezos is designed to provide the code correctness and safety that is necessary for assets and other important use cases. Tezos has a so-called modular architecture, which refers to the design of a system composed of separate components that can be connected together. Together with its formal upgrade mechanism, Tezosâ€™ allows the network to adopt and propose innovations very smoothly. All stakeholders may participate in network upgrades by evaluating, proposing, or approving changes.</p>\n<h3>Who started Tezos</h3>\n<p>Since 2014, co-founders (while being a couple) Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman, have been developing Tezos with a core group of developers. In 2017, the Tezos Foundation headquartered in Switzerland raised $232 million in just two weeks in a fundraiser. It became one of the biggest ICOs.</p>","color":"#2c7df7","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/HkLUdilQ7/xtz.svg","websiteUrl":"https://www.tezos.com","socials":[{"name":"tezos","url":"https://twitter.com/tezos","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/tezos","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"@tezos","url":"https://medium.com/@tezos","type":"medium"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=715818.0","type":"bitcointalk"},{"name":"Youtube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucmexyclrgsifqs_sqmeolqq","type":"youtube"},{"name":"tezos/tezos","url":"https://github.com/tezos/tezos","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"tezos.com","url":"https://www.tezos.com","type":"website"},{"name":"Rewards Calculator","url":"https://stake.fish/tezos/calculator/","type":"website"},{"name":"mytezosbaker.com","url":"https://mytezosbaker.com/","type":"website"},{"name":"Baking Cycles Bot","url":"https://twitter.com/tezosalerts","type":"website"},{"name":"Staking guide","url":"https://www.stakingrewards.com/asset/tezos","type":"website"},{"name":"Earn Tezos","url":"https://www.coinbase.com/earn/tezos","type":"website"},{"name":"tezos","url":"https://twitter.com/tezos","type":"twitter"},{"name":"tezosplatform","url":"https://t.me/tezosplatform","type":"telegram"},{"name":"TezosAnnouncements","url":"https://t.me/TezosAnnouncements","type":"telegram"},{"name":"r/tezos","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"@tezos","url":"https://medium.com/@tezos","type":"medium"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=715818.0","type":"bitcointalk"},{"name":"Youtube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucmexyclrgsifqs_sqmeolqq","type":"youtube"},{"name":"tezos/tezos","url":"https://github.com/tezos/tezos","type":"github"},{"name":"tzstats.com","url":"https://tzstats.com","type":"explorer"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":179,"numberOfExchanges":72,"type":"coin","volume":224578134,"marketCap":3652932378,"price":"0.10188431529648762","circulatingSupply":767523024.697893,"totalSupply":873803992.872245,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1530662400000,"listedAt":1530662400,"change":5.95,"rank":37,"history":["0.24398178484518204","0.23721616995142514","0.2141350366151515","0.2083212703710501","0.20255285439447573","0.19905881765617103","0.18651811214383227","0.1814336284067914","0.17632445743085615","0.17965698967629934","0.16923688427507397","0.15480097804641016","0.15183808732660187","0.15703094991317165","0.15906607102404635","0.14597493337876732","0.1336254540149236","0.13135515755121005","0.12330308639332088","0.12582340147920035","0.12209147939132727","0.12507783697723912","0.12213975858664378","0.11993025035381139","0.11514503336469431","0.11239306706727811","0.10188431529648762"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"7.385377456619106","timestamp":1618617600000},"penalty":false}}
