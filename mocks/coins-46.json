This utility token aims to improve the digital advertising industry. They will achieve this by creating a decentralized ad exchange where publishers will be paid for their content and users for their attention, while providing advertisers with less expensive customer attention, less fraud, and better attribution. Users can also donate BAT back to publishers or use them on the platform.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Basic Attention Token</h3>\n<p>According to the BAT team, digital advertising is broken: “It is a market filled with middlemen and fraudsters, hurting users, publishers and advertisers.” Basic Attention Token was created to improve this. The transparent system wants to keep user data private while delivering less, and at the same time more relevant ads. Publishers experience less fraud while increasing their percentage of rewards. And advertisers get better reporting and performance. The Brave browser is a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers, and contains a ledger system that anonymously measures user attention, which helps to reward the publishers.</p>\n<h3>Who started Basic Attention Token</h3>\n<p>Basic Attention Token was created by the co-founder of Mozilla and Firefox, along with the creator of JavaScript. The ICO of Basic Attention Token (BAT) started in May 2017.</p>","color":"#9e1f63","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/SyX3N05JQ/bat.svg","websiteUrl":"https://basicattentiontoken.org/","socials":[{"name":"attentiontoken","url":"https://twitter.com/attentiontoken","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/batproject","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/batproject/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"@attentiontoken","url":"http://medium.com/@attentiontoken","type":"medium"}],"links":[{"name":"basicattentiontoken.org","type":"website","url":"https://basicattentiontoken.org/"},{"name":"attentiontoken","url":"https://twitter.com/attentiontoken","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/batproject","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/batproject/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"@attentiontoken","url":"http://medium.com/@attentiontoken","type":"medium"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":410,"numberOfExchanges":150,"type":"coin","volume":203454911,"marketCap":1672712864,"price":"0.26670283918826126","circulatingSupply":1492837675.3590019,"totalSupply":1500000000,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1496275200000,"listedAt":1496275200,"change":9.42,"rank":69,"history":["0.21155917484258036","0.214563315125345","0.21162594334127902","0.21659492049093224","0.21035265488238356","0.21634980907308032","0.20862612088917135","0.20296400796823924","0.22255003473717433","0.22744168450069743","0.24681971602015684","0.25026531925579826","0.24763252809722727","0.2529442458249128","0.23498520437134401","0.23142987822920558","0.22909937935543748","0.22262273990105927","0.23945301903757935","0.2452262313265754","0.26889056264958994","0.25302601945326414","0.24797308984478245","0.25156126045483646","0.2566402823034196","0.2605206833718473","0.26670283918826126"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"1.5530790488120791","timestamp":1618617600000},"penalty":false}}
