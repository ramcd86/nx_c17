Instead, a network of thousands of peers is controlling the transactions; a decentralized system.</p> \n<h3>Why does bitcoin have value?</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin’s useful qualities (decentralized, borderless, secure) aren’t the only reason the coin is worth so much. Due to its scarcity (and it’s hard to produce), Bitcoin is often nicknamed ‘Digital Gold’, in reference to ‘classic’ physical gold. Like gold, Bitcoin also has a finite supply of coins available; there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. And now you know why the creation of new bitcoins is also called mining.</p>\n<h3>No inflation in bitcoin</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin was invented in response to a few concerns the inventor(s) had, such as inflation. Its supply is limited, so one cannot just devalue the currency by printing more, as governments often do with fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc.).</p>\n<p>As people look for alternative places to keep their money rather than losing value in a negative interest rate account, Bitcoin becomes more appealing. Big global companies, such as Tesla and MicroStrategy already purchased serious amounts of Bitcoin. And it's only a matter of time that other companies will follow. This also ensures that the value remains or continues to increase.</p>\n<h3>Who built Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>In 2008, Bitcoin was invented by an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2009, Bitcoin was released as open-source software. Nakamoto’s real identity is still unknown, although there are many theories about who it might be. Decentralization is one of Bitcoin’s most important principles, and that’s why this anonymity is perfectly in line.</p>\n<h3>The technology of Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is a database, the so-called ‘ledger’, that consists of bitcoin transaction records. For new transactions to be added to the ledger, the nodes must agree that the transaction is real and valid. The blockchain is public and contains records of all the transactions taking place.</p>\n<h3>How to buy bitcoin?</h3>\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://coinranking.com/blog/how-to-buy-your-first-bitcoin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">this blog article</a> on how to buy your first bitcoin.</p>","color":"#f7931A","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/bOabBYkcX/bitcoin_btc.svg","websiteUrl":"https://bitcoin.org","socials":[{"name":"r/bitcoin","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"bitcoin/bitcoin","url":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"bitcoin.org","type":"website","url":"https://bitcoin.org"},{"name":"Bitcoin Whitepaper","url":"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf","type":"website"},{"name":"r/bitcoin","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"bitcoin/bitcoin","url":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin","type":"github"},{"name":"blockchain.com","url":"https://www.blockchain.com/explorer","type":"explorer"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":20770,"numberOfExchanges":341,"type":"coin","volume":46521361158,"marketCap":938583216457,"price":"38922.8886306176","circulatingSupply":18689950,"totalSupply":18689950,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1330214400000,"listedAt":1330214400,"change":2.6,"rank":1,"history":["40401.17442786957","39457.807004978815","35867.14656752574","36656.22379201131","37633.11215606841","36617.39445897612","35888.7083092425","35294.75018672454","35896.87862491006","36597.22672688206","39858.03962824725","38790.64132700279","37953.53928716607","39809.467358308495","40555.4967766032","41321.995665680995","40629.439018324185","37318.13973833076","36834.496647322","37773.77631182871","34026.6177016953","34389.00118021836","35345.01541302843","38154.94413836419","37494.863604770486","38204.641372808794","38922.8886306176"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"64185.10833403135","timestamp":1618358400000},"penalty":false},{"id":2,"uuid":"razxDUgYGNAdQ","slug":"ethereum-eth","symbol":"ETH","name":"Ethereum","description":"<p>Ethereum (ETH) is a global, public decentralized blockchain designed to run peer-to-peer smart contracts.

HEX is designed to be a store of value to replace the Certificate of Deposit as the blockchain counterpart of that financial product used in traditional financial markets. HEX is also designed to leverage off the emerging DeFi (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem in cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum network.</p>\n<h3>The technology of HEX</h3>\n<p>HEX uses the Ethereum network for the transaction layer (sending and receiving HEX tokens, as well as interacting with the HEX smart contract), whilst the consensus code and staking mechanism is contained in the HEX smart contract.</p>\n<h3>Staking HEX</h3>\n<p>HEX allows a user to stake his or her HEX coins for a share of the new HEX coin issuance, or inflation and contains features designed to incentivize behaviors that encourage price appreciation and disincentivize behaviors that encourage harm to the price. The HEX smart contract penalizes stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of HEX for longer periods. HEX is distributed to Bitcoin holders by way of a snapshot of the Bitcoin UTXO set that occurred on 2 December 2019 at block height 606227. The distribution of HEX to Bitcoin holders is 10,000 HEX per 1 BTC. Bitcoin holders are able to claim HEX only during the first year of launch. During this period, HEX is also obtained in exchange for ETH through interacting with the HEX smart contract. At the end of the first year of launch, all HEX coins that were not claimed by Bitcoin holders are distributed to the rest of the HEX users who have stakes that are active. The maximum possible annual inflation of HEX is designed to be 3.69% after the first year of launch.</p>","color":"#ffcd00","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/iseN4Am58/hex-vector.svg","websiteUrl":null,"socials":[],"links":[{"name":"hex.com","url":"https://hex.com/","type":"website"},{"name":"HEXCrypto","url":"https://twitter.com/HEXCrypto","type":"twitter"},{"name":"HEXcrypto","url":"https://t.me/HEXcrypto","type":"telegram"},{"name":"hexcrypto","url":"https://hexcrypto.reddit.com/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Discord","url":"https://discord.gg/CA8jVuF","type":"discord"},{"name":"HexCrypto","url":"https://youtube.com/HexCrypto?sub_confirmation=1","type":"youtube"},{"name":"HEXcrypto","url":"https://www.facebook.com/HEXcrypto","type":"facebook"},{"name":"HEXcrypto","url":"https://www.instagram.com/HEXcrypto","type":"instagram"},{"name":"bitcoinHEX","url":"https://github.com/bitcoinHEX","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":30,"numberOfExchanges":21,"type":"coin","volume":8560942,"marketCap":9333289956,"price":"2.1074104659460264","circulatingSupply":569700641037.7662,"totalSupply":569899770700.9384,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1589361480000,"listedAt":1589361480,"change":-1.68,"rank":18,"history":["3.4341279147337844","3.3625606889907322","3.2886852306536056","3.1966020441953047","3.1232400272810223","3.062899029953953","3.0082569112595743","2.9229427452562526","3.01051410990413","2.960328839692028","2.9128451651033678","2.7680767603977303","2.7171441480064122","2.640276140059311","2.702481045919108","2.759179098262491","2.838698639874416","2.76537505400646","2.6492293017381887","2.6907162326034086","2.4816475813301238","2.449510245151899","2.48887387479149","2.288519527870775","2.314196716973485","2.1364664091099215","2.1074104659460264"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"0.021599219104475594","timestamp":1617926400000},"penalty":false},{"id":74500,"uuid":"ymQub4fuB","slug":"filecoin-fil","symbol":"FIL","name":"Filecoin","description":"Filecoin (FIL) is a cryptocurrency used on the blockchain system called Filecoin.

It differs from Bitcoin's in a few key ways, but is very similar to Bitcoin: it’s an anonymous version of Bitcoin. It can be used to buy and sell things, and be exchanged for other coins or tokens.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Monero</h3>\n<p>The privacy features of Monero gives it its most value. No one can link Monero cryptocurrency transactions to a person. Monero is also created for its fungibility, all Monero coins are identical and mutually interchangeable. Monero has dynamic scalability, which means it has no “pre-set” block size limit. Monero has ASIC resistance and multiple keys.</p>\n<h3>Who started Monero</h3>\n<p>Bytecoin, launched in 2012, was the precursor of Monero. It was the first digital currency that was written using a technology called CryptoNote. CryptoNote is the spine of most of the privacy-based cryptocurrencies that exist, including Monero. However, there were a few issues with Bytecoin, which lead to a group of seven developers to fork the Bytecoin blockchain. The new currency would be known as Bitmonero, later named Monero. Five of the seven developers decided to stay anonymous. Only two of these Monero developers are known: Riccardo Spagni and David Latapie.</p>","color":"#ff7519","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/Syz-oSd_Z/xmr.svg","websiteUrl":"https://getmonero.org/","socials":[{"name":"monerocurrency","url":"https://twitter.com/monerocurrency","type":"twitter"},{"name":"bitmonero","url":"https://telegram.me/bitmonero","type":"telegram"},{"name":"r/monero","url":"https://reddit.com/r/monero","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.0","type":"bitcointalk"}],"links":[{"name":"getmonero.org","type":"website","url":"https://getmonero.org/"},{"name":"monero","url":"https://twitter.com/monero","type":"twitter"},{"name":"bitmonero","url":"https://telegram.me/bitmonero","type":"telegram"},{"name":"r/monero","url":"https://reddit.com/r/monero","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.0","type":"bitcointalk"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":705,"numberOfExchanges":112,"type":"coin","volume":467096362,"marketCap":6606847667,"price":"8.707070180046282","circulatingSupply":17894094.44343485,"totalSupply":17894094.44343485,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1422489600000,"listedAt":1422489600,"change":11.87,"rank":24,"history":["9.100588316411988","9.274864582671277","9.426137624014647","9.060403484202878","9.961007590532644","9.855321299997092","10.039714361520037","9.12911226893017","8.955659135820497","9.176863916475263","9.525584745301323","9.807542053762242","9.912286602896422","9.755771597436688","9.603776675948625","9.461064554544029","9.573745833388648","9.806962281889994","9.003772071003205","8.741492190574881","8.867631922884877","9.038777218996556","8.818954157030559","8.68931553092221","8.569402976595484","8.453630342381679","8.707070180046282"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"447.98507184923585","timestamp":1515369600000},"penalty":false},{"id":15,"uuid":"cVaOmQWainv7g","slug":"neo-neo","symbol":"NEO","name":"NEO","description":"<p>Neo (NEO) is a distributed smart economy network that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity.

Tezos is designed to provide the code correctness and safety that is necessary for assets and other important use cases. Tezos has a so-called modular architecture, which refers to the design of a system composed of separate components that can be connected together. Together with its formal upgrade mechanism, Tezos’ allows the network to adopt and propose innovations very smoothly.

It is a smart contract platform that controls and sells Dai; Maker stabilizes the value of Dai to one U.S. dollar using external market mechanisms and economic incentives. Without the need of using a third centralized party, Maker aims to offer a transparent stablecoin system that is operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The Maker Platform has two coins: Makercoin (MKR) and Dai (DAI); Dai is a stable coin that is used for payments, savings, or collateral.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Maker</h3>\n<p>Maker has three important functions on the Maker Platform. The first is utility; you can only use Maker to pay the fees accumulated on Customer Data Platforms (CPDs) that generate Dai in the Maker system. When someone pays a fee, a Maker coin is burned from the supply, which will then decrease. The second function is governance; holders use Maker to vote for the risk management and logistics of the Maker system. And the third is recapitalization resource. If parts of the collateral portfolio become under-collateralized, the system immediately creates new Maker tokens and sells them. This gains money to capitalize the shortfall of value in the system and brings the entire Maker system back from insolvency.</p>","color":"#1abc9c","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/sjHfS7jCS/mkrdao.svg","websiteUrl":"https://makerdao.com","socials":[],"links":[{"name":"makerdao.com","type":"website","url":"https://makerdao.com"},{"name":"r/makerdao","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/makerdao/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"@makerdao","url":"https://medium.com/@makerdao","type":"medium"},{"name":"makerdao","url":"https://github.com/makerdao/","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":223,"numberOfExchanges":101,"type":"coin","volume":459202900,"marketCap":3508132051,"price":"0.040745761499654296","circulatingSupply":901682.582538043,"totalSupply":995238.7713171599,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1502236800000,"listedAt":1502236800,"change":7.87,"rank":38,"history":["0.03951597085498357","0.03892046517419896","0.03818097633588918","0.035951207317873254","0.0351897607468807","0.03282500882469031","0.03333839196270847","0.032472927307356556","0.031771512077517654","0.03215308793756864","0.030918409360766","0.03138805999895604","0.032098057916132426","0.032657206085031455","0.03333255710686991","0.03242657820470518","0.032065346123504763","0.03306257838794576","0.03366101105676758","0.03448907192876406","0.034909148824856406","0.033701292275516374","0.034620663528792464","0.0377676818435597","0.03696851769574998","0.03749494938773746","0.040745761499654296"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"4494.790411631041","timestamp":1619049600000},"penalty":false},{"id":68589,"uuid":"MoTuySvg7","slug":"dai-dai","symbol":"DAI","name":"Dai","description":"Dai (DAI) is a stable, decentralized currency.

With Compound, users are able to earn money on the coins they save. People can also borrow crypto from Compound by putting up collateral above a threshold defined by the project. The project focuses on allowing borrowers to take out loans and lenders to provide loans by locking their crypto assets into the protocol. The interest rates paid and received by borrowers and lenders are determined by the supply and demand of each crypto asset. Interest rates are generated with every block mined. Loans can be paid back and locked assets can be withdrawn at any time.</p>\n\n<h3>Who started Compound</h3>\n\n<p>Compound was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Robert Leshner, a former economist, is the founder and CEO of Compound. He is a web designer and financial analyst and wants to make privacy

It wants to enable the user to purchase items online or in-stores, without going through a central authority. Dash is based on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, and secured by strong cryptography. Dash describes itself as portable, inexpensive, divisible, and fast digital cash for both the internet and everyday life. Dash is an open protocol not under the control of any single entity. Anyone can write software to transact on the Dash network without requiring the permission of a central authority. Dash only asks a small fee to prevent spam attacks.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Dash</h3>\n<p>Dash is used around the world as a practical alternative to cash and credit cards, low fees and fast transactions. It is also meant as s solution in the international remittances market.
