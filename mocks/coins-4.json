{"base":{"symbol":"USD","sign":"$"},"coin":{"id":4,"uuid":"ZlZpzOJo43mIo","slug":"bitcoincash-bch","symbol":"BCH","name":"Bitcoin Cash","description":"<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard fork of bitcoin. It’s an electronic cash platform that allows peer-to-peer online cash payments to be made without the clearance of a clearinghouse. One of the most pressing issues for bitcoin has always been its scalability; the size of a block of transactions was limited to one MB. Bitcoin Cash was initiated to increase this block size.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin cash is very similar to bitcoin and also used as a payment system. Bitcoin Cash allows faster transaction times and lower transaction fees; it enabled the increase of the block size from one MB to eight MB. Its overall goal is to increase the number of transactions that can be processed by the network.</p>\n<h3>Who started Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash was officially released in August 2017, as a result of a discussion about the scalability of Bitcoin; the community had some concerns about Bitcoin’s ability to process the large number of transactions on the Bitcoin network. Looking for a solution, the community was divided into two groups. Unable to find a compromise, a hard fork was implemented, and Bitcoin Cash was created.</p>","color":"#8dc451","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/By8ziihX7/bch.svg","websiteUrl":"https://www.bitcoincash.org/","socials":[{"name":"bitcolncash","url":"https://twitter.com/bitcolncash","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/bitcoincash","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincash/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2040221.0","type":"bitcointalk"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/bitcoincashorg","type":"facebook"},{"name":"bitcoin-abc","url":"https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"www.bitcoincash.org","type":"website","url":"https://www.bitcoincash.org/"},{"name":"bitcolncash","url":"https://twitter.com/bitcolncash","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/bitcoincash","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincash/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Bitcoin Talk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2040221.0","type":"bitcointalk"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/bitcoincashorg","type":"facebook"},{"name":"bitcoin-abc","url":"https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":991,"numberOfExchanges":235,"type":"coin","volume":2854727287,"marketCap":15070559823,"price":"253.5126692493941","circulatingSupply":18716912.39678949,"totalSupply":18716912.39678949,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1541808000000,"listedAt":1541808000,"change":2.56,"rank":11,"history":["171.7372492501896","182.26474262922622","191.41443270921337","196.6879003303522","215.60927634213206","218.58468435565348","215.14853311758262","221.2824177967649","226.68170879100595","231.5825673350675","238.33319917288472","241.83669720072612","235.137820688266","220.86495497248825","227.1993618810992","230.53919250075137","225.19298862665894","222.4388783757549","228.50923536662927","225.90651517580335","228.48862664426278","217.47547484000933","228.17526820213777","232.95325831829052","248.67760325477514","245.03447636709268","253.5126692493941"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"1123.9616172791752","timestamp":1618617600000},"penalty":false}}
