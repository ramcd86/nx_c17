    "description": "<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard fork of bitcoin. It’s an electronic cash platform that allows peer-to-peer online cash payments to be made without the clearance of a clearinghouse. One of the most pressing issues for bitcoin has always been its scalability; the size of a block of transactions was limited to one MB. Bitcoin Cash was initiated to increase this block size.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin cash is very similar to bitcoin and also used as a payment system. Bitcoin Cash allows faster transaction times and lower transaction fees; it enabled the increase of the block size from one MB to eight MB. Its overall goal is to increase the number of transactions that can be processed by the network.</p>\n<h3>Who started Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash was officially released in August 2017, as a result of a discussion about the scalability of Bitcoin; the community had some concerns about Bitcoin’s ability to process the large number of transactions on the Bitcoin network. Looking for a solution, the community was divided into two groups. Unable to find a compromise, a hard fork was implemented, and Bitcoin Cash was created.</p>",
