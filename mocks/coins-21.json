Transactions on its proof of work blockchain are untraceable because of zero-knowledge cryptography. It was created in response to, their words, bitcoin’s flaws. It uses the same algorithm as bitcoin but then in combination with semi-transparent processing, to avoid the transparency of bitcoin. The user transaction data is revealed selectively.</p>\n<h3>The goal of ZCash</h3>\n<p>Zcash is developed to overcome bitcoin’s privacy “flaws” and uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify and validate transactions. ZCash’s blockchain aims to provide practical utility for businesses and large organizations interested in systems that combine the benefits of blockchain technology with privacy.</p>\n<h3>Who started ZCash</h3>\n<p>In 2016, ZCash was founded by Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn in response to demands for an open financial system with added privacy features. Zcash’s roots lie in Zerocoin, which was developed in the 1980s; ZCash was initially launched as Zerocash back in 2014.</p>","color":"#000","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/rJrKiS_uZ/zec.svg","websiteUrl":"https://z.cash/","socials":[{"name":"zcashco","url":"https://twitter.com/zcashco","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/zec","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"zcash","url":"https://github.com/zcash","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"z.cash","type":"website","url":"https://z.cash/"},{"name":"electriccoinco","url":"https://twitter.com/electriccoinco","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/zec","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"zcash","url":"https://github.com/zcash","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":441,"numberOfExchanges":132,"type":"coin","volume":758442441,"marketCap":2449790664,"price":"306.5056476362725","circulatingSupply":11620487.5,"totalSupply":11620487.5,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1477612800000,"listedAt":1477612800,"change":5.9,"rank":52,"history":["326.9352800096064","341.94160936204736","348.17520490071746","315.3422830785798","306.1752829094855","297.5931897295326","303.39625692925847","279.2155752519966","284.4508672879715","269.2043008013362","282.3953115406017","275.101040643508","300.8780081518047","295.0169045530075","289.5325402973671","310.37888319877754","324.3459329427225","314.69664143767653","343.2710964802176","348.31374888751196","340.1597240260553","333.3565295455342","320.6223101168948","313.831529588619","308.0821359665555","314.8168114587844","306.5056476362725"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"5000.000001019066","timestamp":1477612800000},"penalty":false}}
