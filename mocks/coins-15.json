In 2017 the project was rebranded as NEO. NEO has an active development team with both in-house developers in charge of developing the platform and a strong community of third-party developers, who develop the decentralized apps (DApps).</p>\n<h3>Neo technology</h3>\n<p>NEO is a unique blockchain algorithm, supporting decentralized commerce, identification, and digitization of various assets. It integrates blockchain technology with the digital identity, creating ways for physical assets like money or company shares assets to be digitized and exchanged over the NEO network in a peer-to-peer manner.
