    "description": "<p>Ripple is both a digital currency (XRP) and an open payment network within which that currency is transferred. Ripple connects banks from all around the world, to provide immediate cross-border transactions with fewer intermediaries. Ripple aims to provide both parties an end-to-end visibility throughout the transactions. The main purpose of XRP is to make it possible to exchange cryptocurrencies and fiat.</p>\n<h3>The goal of XRP</h3>\n<p>XRP is built on bitcoinâ€™s decentralized digital currency approach. XRP aims to be a payment ecosystem, providing a low commission currency exchange with fast international transactions.</p>\n<h3>Who started XRP</h3>\n<p>XRP was first released in 2012 by a company named OpenCoin, with co-founders CEO Chris Larsen and CTO Jed McCaleb. Both co-founders have a background in bitcoin, as well as the other developers working on the XRP protocol.</p>",
