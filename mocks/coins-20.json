    "description": "<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) is the famous Doge internet meme turned into a full-fledged cryptocurrency. It is created to be a joke currency but it grew into something bigger and more serious than intended. Dogecoin is now described as a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that aims to enable users to easily send money online. The dog is their mascot and was popularized as an online meme and represents the coin.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Dogecoin</h3>\n<p>Dogecoin’s goal was to make a funny cryptocurrency that would be free from controversies that normally surrounded all the others. The Dogecoin community has frequently raised funds for charitable causes, from the 2014 Winter Olympics to NASCAR. Dogecoin is a fork of Litecoin.\n<h3>Who started Dogecoin</h3>\n<p>In 2013, Dogecoin was launched by Billy Markus, Jackson Palmer, and “Shibetoshi Nakamoto”; this is not a real person, but refers to Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto and the Shiba Inu breed of dogs, the logo of this cryptocurrency.</p>",
