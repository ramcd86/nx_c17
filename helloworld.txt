Instead, a network of thousands of peers is controlling the transactions; a decentralized system.</p> \n<h3>Why does bitcoin have value?</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin’s useful qualities (decentralized, borderless, secure) aren’t the only reason the coin is worth so much. Due to its scarcity (and it’s hard to produce), Bitcoin is often nicknamed ‘Digital Gold’, in reference to ‘classic’ physical gold. Like gold, Bitcoin also has a finite supply of coins available; there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. And now you know why the creation of new bitcoins is also called mining.</p>\n<h3>No inflation in bitcoin</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin was invented in response to a few concerns the inventor(s) had, such as inflation. Its supply is limited, so one cannot just devalue the currency by printing more, as governments often do with fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc.).</p>\n<p>As people look for alternative places to keep their money rather than losing value in a negative interest rate account, Bitcoin becomes more appealing. Big global companies, such as Tesla and MicroStrategy already purchased serious amounts of Bitcoin. And it's only a matter of time that other companies will follow. This also ensures that the value remains or continues to increase.</p>\n<h3>Who built Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>In 2008, Bitcoin was invented by an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2009, Bitcoin was released as open-source software. Nakamoto’s real identity is still unknown, although there are many theories about who it might be. Decentralization is one of Bitcoin’s most important principles, and that’s why this anonymity is perfectly in line.</p>\n<h3>The technology of Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is a database, the so-called ‘ledger’, that consists of bitcoin transaction records. For new transactions to be added to the ledger, the nodes must agree that the transaction is real and valid. The blockchain is public and contains records of all the transactions taking place.</p>\n<h3>How to buy bitcoin?</h3>\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://coinranking.com/blog/how-to-buy-your-first-bitcoin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">this blog article</a> on how to buy your first bitcoin.</p>","color":"#f7931A","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/bOabBYkcX/bitcoin_btc.svg","websiteUrl":"https://bitcoin.org","socials":[{"name":"r/bitcoin","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"bitcoin/bitcoin","url":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"bitcoin.org","type":"website","url":"https://bitcoin.org"},{"name":"Bitcoin Whitepaper","url":"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf","type":"website"},{"name":"r/bitcoin","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"bitcoin/bitcoin","url":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin","type":"github"},{"name":"blockchain.com","url":"https://www.blockchain.com/explorer","type":"explorer"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":20745,"numberOfExchanges":341,"type":"coin","volume":48933541163,"marketCap":1015255575645,"price":"54326.1679537361","circulatingSupply":18688150,"totalSupply":18688150,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1330214400000,"listedAt":1330214400,"change":-2.5,"rank":1,"history":["55717.1030614753","55860.7559204752","56130.1881300887","55809.5020817315","55383.7914922892","55540.5536499359","56039.3578757489","56226.4861266387","56657.124268844","56587.8378346661","56218.3330945078","56013.6745833899","55949.9813039634","55815.7829280734","55495.4883369866","55429.973623574","54409.3096416331","54688.7938661078","54963.1446411359","55177.4265821068","54554.1947476453","54723.6031231065","54645.3337487116","54539.6646072375","54944.2235896633","54579.3861390274","54326.1679537361"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"64185.10833403135","timestamp":1618358400000},"penalty":false},{"id":2,"uuid":"razxDUgYGNAdQ","slug":"ethereum-eth","symbol":"ETH","name":"Ethereum","description":"<p>Ethereum (ETH) is a global, public decentralized blockchain designed to run peer-to-peer smart contracts.

HEX is designed to be a store of value to replace the Certificate of Deposit as the blockchain counterpart of that financial product used in traditional financial markets. HEX is also designed to leverage off the emerging DeFi (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem in cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum network.</p>\n<h3>The technology of HEX</h3>\n<p>HEX uses the Ethereum network for the transaction layer (sending and receiving HEX tokens, as well as interacting with the HEX smart contract), whilst the consensus code and staking mechanism is contained in the HEX smart contract.</p>\n<h3>Staking HEX</h3>\n<p>HEX allows a user to stake his or her HEX coins for a share of the new HEX coin issuance, or inflation and contains features designed to incentivize behaviors that encourage price appreciation and disincentivize behaviors that encourage harm to the price. The HEX smart contract penalizes stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of HEX for longer periods. HEX is distributed to Bitcoin holders by way of a snapshot of the Bitcoin UTXO set that occurred on 2 December 2019 at block height 606227. The distribution of HEX to Bitcoin holders is 10,000 HEX per 1 BTC. Bitcoin holders are able to claim HEX only during the first year of launch.

(MKR) is a token on the Ethereum blockchain with the aim to govern, secure and support the Dai Stable Coin system (DCS). It is a smart contract platform that controls and sells Dai; Maker stabilizes the value of Dai to one U.S. dollar using external market mechanisms and economic incentives. Without the need of using a third centralized party, Maker aims to offer a transparent stablecoin system that is operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The Maker Platform has two coins: Makercoin (MKR) and Dai (DAI); Dai is a stable coin that is used for payments, savings, or collateral.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Maker</h3>\n<p>Maker has three important functions on the Maker Platform. The first is utility; you can only use Maker to pay the fees accumulated on Customer Data Platforms (CPDs) that generate Dai in the Maker system. When someone pays a fee, a Maker coin is burned from the supply, which will then decrease. The second function is governance; holders use Maker to vote for the risk management and logistics of the Maker system. And the third is recapitalization resource. If parts of the collateral portfolio become under-collateralized, the system immediately creates new Maker tokens and sells them. This gains money to capitalize the shortfall of value in the system and brings the entire Maker system back from insolvency.</p>","color":"#1abc9c","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/sjHfS7jCS/mkrdao.svg","websiteUrl":"https://makerdao.com","socials":[],"links":[{"name":"makerdao.com","type":"website","url":"https://makerdao.com"},{"name":"r/makerdao","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/makerdao/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"@makerdao","url":"https://medium.com/@makerdao","type":"medium"},{"name":"makerdao","url":"https://github.com/makerdao/","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":223,"numberOfExchanges":101,"type":"coin","volume":1071373425,"marketCap":4141778001,"price":"4593.388051332","circulatingSupply":901682.582538043,"totalSupply":995238.7713171599,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1502236800000,"listedAt":1502236800,"change":28.44,"rank":35,"history":["3576.3434113482","3565.6183061061","3583.3970614689","3513.1334442821","3454.4714923745","3547.7074723433","3628.2709998822","3770.322166746","3876.4111829292","3893.2922781558","3932.8467726708","4139.8917703061","4128.2290658953","4118.8085124868","4049.890965122","4034.0536472331","3949.7827883887","4097.5800468497","4375.9043586045","4481.3150041688","4414.1020494262","4341.9171454983","4363.5610573053","4558.3760361957","4823.8546710322","4793.0076222648","4593.388051332"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"4383.449996185815","timestamp":1502841600000},"penalty":false},{"id":18,"uuid":"fsIbGOEJWbzxG","slug":"tezos-xtz","symbol":"XTZ","name":"Tezos","description":"<p>Tezos (XTZ) is a smart contract platform that uses blockchain voting to be self-governing by its token holders.

Tezos is designed to provide the code correctness and safety that is necessary for assets and other important use cases. Tezos has a so-called modular architecture, which refers to the design of a system composed of separate components that can be connected together. Together with its formal upgrade mechanism, Tezos’ allows the network to adopt and propose innovations very smoothly. All stakeholders may participate in network upgrades by evaluating, proposing, or approving changes.</p>\n<h3>Who started Tezos</h3>\n<p>Since 2014, co-founders (while being a couple) Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman, have been developing Tezos with a core group of developers. In 2017, the Tezos Foundation headquartered in Switzerland raised $232 million in just two weeks in a fundraiser.

(ZEC) is a fully anonymous and decentralized blockchain and cryptocurrency. Transactions on its proof of work blockchain are untraceable because of zero-knowledge cryptography. It was created in response to, their words, bitcoin’s flaws. It uses the same algorithm as bitcoin but then in combination with semi-transparent processing, to avoid the transparency of bitcoin. The user transaction data is revealed selectively.</p>\n<h3>The goal of ZCash</h3>\n<p>Zcash is developed to overcome bitcoin’s privacy “flaws” and uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify and validate transactions. ZCash’s blockchain aims to provide practical utility for businesses and large organizations interested in systems that combine the benefits of blockchain technology with privacy.</p>\n<h3>Who started ZCash</h3>\n<p>In 2016, ZCash was founded by Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn in response to demands for an open financial system with added privacy features. Zcash’s roots lie in Zerocoin, which was developed in the 1980s; ZCash was initially launched as Zerocash back in 2014.</p>","color":"#000","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/rJrKiS_uZ/zec.svg","websiteUrl":"https://z.cash/","socials":[{"name":"zcashco","url":"https://twitter.com/zcashco","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/zec","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"zcash","url":"https://github.com/zcash","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"z.cash","type":"website","url":"https://z.cash/"},{"name":"electriccoinco","url":"https://twitter.com/electriccoinco","type":"twitter"},{"name":"r/zec","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"zcash","url":"https://github.com/zcash","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":441,"numberOfExchanges":132,"type":"coin","volume":716376324,"marketCap":2755839236,"price":"237.4454374306","circulatingSupply":11606200,"totalSupply":11606200,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1477612800000,"listedAt":1477612800,"change":-2.26,"rank":50,"history":["242.9403968902","243.9517695026","243.5578970567","237.9930606032","236.569221734","238.6195472139","241.5654733125","242.4866305496","249.7726670142","252.3705653134","248.7992801432","247.800809124","248.5747257272","249.8004979962","246.7981886643","245.1996805076","238.5084748323","239.6135384556","240.6144694521","242.0870019611","239.1277113642","238.5982957827","238.6461511169","239.4001208567","241.6605481403","238.7926243532","237.4454374306"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"5000.000001019066","timestamp":1477612800000},"penalty":false}]}
